Since there are too many tabs opened and favorited in the browser now, I want to make a chrome plug-in for finding, jumping and managing them. The following is the design and development plan:
Phase 1: MVP
Browser extension framework: Build a basic browser extension to ensure that it can run on different browsers.
Get tabs and bookmarks: Use the browser API to get the currently open tabs and bookmarks list.
Basic search: Implement a simple keyword search that can search in tabs and bookmark titles.

Phase 2: Improved version
Page content extraction: Add functions to extract page content from tabs.
Keyword analysis: Use simple NLP technology to extract keywords from page content.
Fuzzy search: Introduce fuzzy search function,
Perform relevance matching in tabs and bookmark content based on keywords.

Phase 3: Advanced version
Performance optimization: Optimize the extraction of content and keyword analysis to ensure that the speed and resource usage are within an acceptable range.
User interface improvement: Improve the user experience of the search interface and add shortcut key support.
Bookmark and tag management: Implement advanced functions such as tag grouping and bookmark management.
Phase 4: Full Version
Cross-browser support: Optimize the plugin to ensure smooth operation on major browsers.
Personalization: Add user preferences to allow customized search and display options.
Smart sorting: Use more advanced algorithms to intelligently arrange search results based on user habits.
